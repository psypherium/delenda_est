    <History>Mercenary archers from the big island of Crete. They were widely regarded as the best archers in all of Greece and had a long tradition of hiring themselves out to Hellenic states such as Athens for service aboard Trireme naval vessels. Alexander hired them to accompany him on his world conquest march and while in his service they duelled admirably with the greatly feared eastern archers. Later, the Seleucids, Ptolemies, and even Romans would hire these excellent archers to augment their field armies or garrison troublesome cities.</History>

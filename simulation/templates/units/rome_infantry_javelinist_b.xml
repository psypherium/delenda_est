    <History>The Velites (sing. Veles) were the light skirmish infantry of the Polybian legion. They were the younger men who could not afford hastatus equipment or boys too young to serve otherwise. They usually numbered 1200 men in squads of twenty assigned to the maniples of the Hastati, Principes, and Triarii. Their job was to harry the enemy lines before the heavy infantry engaged and to support the cavalry. </History>

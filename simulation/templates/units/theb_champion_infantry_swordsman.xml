    <History>The Thespians were among the 700 or so soldiers to stay behind and hold the pass at Thermopylae to delay the Persians long enough for the rest of the Greek army to withdraw. This heroic deed made the Thespians "friends forever" to the Spartans. Later, Thespiae was an influential member of the Boeotian Confederacy.</History>

    <History>The Ptolemaic kings invited Greeks, Macedonians, Galatians (Gauls), Cretans, and Thracians alike to settle within Egypt in military colonies called cleruchies (Klērouchia﻿). Under this arrangement, the settlers were given a plot of land, or a kleros, and in return were required to serve in the great king's army when called to duty. This created a upper-middle class of military settlers who owed their livelihoods and fortunes to the Ptolemaic kings and helped grow the available manpower for the imperial Ptolemaic army. A side effect of this system was that it drained the Greek homeland of military-aged men, a contributing factor to Greece's eventual conquest by Rome.</History>
    <Tooltip>This is the Ptolemaic expansion building, similar to Civic Centers for other factions. It is weaker, more prone to capture, and has a smaller territory influence, but is cheaper and builds a lot faster.</Tooltip>
